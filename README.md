# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: emUSB-Device suspend and resume

This code example demonstrates how an PSOC&trade; Edge MCU detects a USB suspend condition, enters a low-power state, and restores normal operation when USB activity resumes.

The PSOC&trade; Edge MCU operates in the CPU active power mode before the host decides to suspend the USB device. The PSOC&trade; Edge CM33 CPU goes to sleep as soon as USB suspend condition is detected, to consume less power. The USB device maximum suspend current should not exceed 500 µA (for a low-power device) to be compliant with the USB specification. When the host decides to wake up the USB device, it drives a resume condition on the bus. This drives the PSOC&trade; Edge CM33 CPU to wake up and change its power mode to CPU active. This example uses an 'User LED1' to indicate the USB device state and the PSOC&trade; Edge CM33 CPU power mode. The 'User LED1' is off when a suspend condition is detected. The LED is on when the USB is active.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: emUSB-Device suspend and resume" is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 1. KitProg3 output on program startup**

   ![](images/emusb_suspend_resume.png)

4. Connect another USB cable to the USB device connector (J30) present on the kit

5. Verify that a new USB device enumerates as a virtual COM port in the PC

6. Open any terminal emulator application and select the USB COM port identified in step 5. Ensure that all other configuration settings remain as specified in step 2
   
   After successful configuration, observe “USB is active” message periodically displayed on the terminal. Also, notice that the kit 'User LED1' (red LED) is on

   **Figure 2. USB device active output**

   ![](images/usbd_device_active_output.png)

7. To put the device into suspend mode on a Windows PC, go to the **Start** menu and put the PC into sleep mode

    This makes the USB traffic stop. PSOC&trade; Edge CM33 CPU enters the sleep mode when USB suspend state is detected, and the 'User LED1' turns off.

   **Figure 3. KitProg3 USB device suspend mode output**

   ![](images/kitprog3_usbd_device_suspend.png)

   > **Note:** 
   > 1. When putting the PC in sleep mode, the board should be powered either by connecting the KitProg3 connector to another PC or power source
    >  2. If the USB host cable is disconnected while keeping the board powered through the KitProg connector, the device goes to sleep

8.  Use the mouse or keyboard to wake up the PC  
   
    The host generates a resume condition on the USB. PSOC&trade; Edge CM33 CPU resumes and restores communication through USB (the device is not enumerated again). Observe that the 'User LED1' turns back on.

    **Figure 4. KitProg3 USB device resume mode output**

      ![](images/kitprog3_usbd_device_resume.png)

9.  After the PC wakes up, the communication with the USB device can be observed as described in step 6
